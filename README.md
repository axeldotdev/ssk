# SaaS Starter Kit (SSK)

The goal of SSK is to help you build your app quickly and it brings you a ton of cool features on top of Laravel Breeze.

If you would like a Livewire version, let's connect on Twitter. If a lot of people are interested I could make some time for it.

```

By default the database is **SQLite** and the session, cache and jobs are stored in it. It allows you to start building your app quickly and focus on the system later.
